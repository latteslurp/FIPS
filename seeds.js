        description: "To build muscle through weight lifting, you need to have both mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue. When you lift a heavy weight, the contractile proteins in the muscles must generate force to overturn the resistance provided by the weight. In turn, this can result in structural damage to the muscles. Mechanical damage to muscle proteins stimulates a repair response in the body. The damaged fibers in muscle proteins result in an increase in muscle size. Mechanical fatigue occurs when the muscle fibers exhaust the available supply of ATP, an energy component that helps your muscles contract. They arenâ€™t able to continue fueling muscular contractions or can no longer lift the weight properly. This can also lead to muscle gain. Both mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue are important for achieving muscular hypertrophy. (https://www.healthline.com/health/muscular-hypertrophy#how-to)",

Conversely, consuming the wrong foods or not consuming enough of the right ones will leave you with subpar results.(https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bodybuilding-meal-plan)",
